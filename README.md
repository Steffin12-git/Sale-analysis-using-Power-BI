# 📊 Power BI Sales Analysis & Forecasting Project

This repository contains my in-depth Power BI project inspired by the [Sales Dashboard Tutorial by Priyanka Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwe8C7K8fXY). The aim of this project is to understand and apply key Power BI concepts including data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, visualization, and forecasting.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This Power BI project demonstrates:

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**  
  Removed nulls, standardized formats, and corrected inconsistencies using Power Query Editor.

- 🧮 **Data Modeling**  
  Created relationships between fact and dimension tables to build a proper star schema.

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards**  
  Built with slicers, filters, KPIs, bar charts, line charts, and pivot tables.

- 📈 **Sales Forecasting**  
  Implemented Power BI's built-in forecasting to project future sales trends.

- 🧠 **DAX Calculations**  
  Used DAX for measures such as:
  - Total Sales
  - Total Profit
  - Month-over-Month Growth

- 🔁 **Pivot Charts and Tables**  
  Used to break down performance by region, product, and customer segment.
